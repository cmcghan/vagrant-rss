#(It's also asking you to change the permissions of the ttyACM0 USB port, but that might not be possible without the Arduino connected to the computer...)
#Apparently to do the Arduino tutorials, I need access to the dialout group. Would it be possible for you to do this?
# from Cat:
#Farther down the page:
#"Didn't work for me... no /dev/ttyACM0. On my Ubuntu 14xx found out that all I needed to do was to set Tools|Port in the IDE to /dev/ttyUSB0"
#Might want to try this. If it doesn't work still, then we'll have to handle this in real-time most likely -- you plug it in and I run the necessary sudo commands while it's connected up, to change the access rights so that you can get at it. Should only need to do it the once, I think. Let me know.
# from Sandra:
#So I switched back from ttyS0 to ttyACM0 and now it just works. I'm really confused as to why though.
